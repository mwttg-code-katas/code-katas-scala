# The Magic Forest

## Task
There are three species of animals in a magic forest: lions, wolves and goats. 
Wolves can devour goats, and lions can devour wolves and goats. 
("The stronger animal eats the weaker one".)  
As this is a magic forest:
* a wolf, after having devoured a goat, is transmuted into a lion; 
* a lion, after having devoured a goat, is transmuted into a wolf; and
* a lion having devoured a wolf becomes a goat.

At the very beginning, there are 17 goats, 55 wolves and 6 lions in the forest. 
After every meal, there is one animal fewer than before; 
therefore after some time, there is no devouring possible any more.

What is the maximum number of animals who can live in the forest then?

## Bonus
Provide a devouring strategy leading to this number
