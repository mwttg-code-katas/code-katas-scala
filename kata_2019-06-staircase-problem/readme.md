# Staircase Problem
## Task 1
Write a function `num_way(stairs: Int)`.
This functions should return the number of ways one can go up a staircase, if one can only take one stair or two stair with one step.

### Example (a staircase with 2 stairs)
```
  _|    second stair
_|      first stair
```
There are exactly two ways to go up this staircase:
* Take two stairs with the first step
* Take the first stair with the first step, take the second stair with the second step

[Hint](hint-task1.md)

## Task 2
Write a function `num_way(stairs: Int, allowedSteps: List[Int])`.
Like in Task 1 the function should return the number of ways one can go up a staircase, but this time the number of steps one can take is a parameter of the function.
